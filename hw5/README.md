# Homework 5

Assignment-specific code, along with the plots and discussion, is in a Jupyter
Notebook file, [_hw5.ipynb_](hw5.ipynb). Code taken directly from the lecture
notebooks, with a few minor changes, is included through
[_hw\_support.py_](hw_support.py).

The man feature of the homework is a FEM solution to the temperature equation,
set up with functions using the same form as the example code, which is still
used to solve for pressure. The functions were modified to pass through extra
parameters (here, the pressure solution and the other values for _u_ = _q_ /
&phi;).
